### My name is Epsilon, and I'm out here looking to improve myself and start a career in coding, either full stack or front-end.

I have a background in computer science, with a degree from Aarhus university. I have previously studied biology, and thus have a great foundation in solving problems in the interface between the two subjects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website managing turn order, hidden rolls, music, and resources for GM's during pen & paper role-playing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning front end web development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: epsijes@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any gender neutral, but mostly they/them (de/dem in Danish).
- âš¡ Fun fact: Orcas are known to attack elk when they swim across the ocean.
